  title: "NeuroDesk - A scalable and easy to use data analysis environment for reproducible neuroimaging"
  image: neurodesk.jpg
  details: "Neuroimaging researchers require a diverse collection of bespoke command-line and graphical tools
  to analyse data and answer research questions. Installing and maintaining a neuroimaging software setup is
  challenging and often results in un-reproducible environments. Container technology, such as docker or singularity, enables the execution of software
  on different operating systems and could aid in distributing scientific software. We are developing NeuroDesk, a
  platform build on container technology for processing and analysing neuroimaging data with the aim to lower the
  barrier of using various neuroimaging software in a reproducible environment, so that researchers spend less time on
  setting up and maintaining an analysis environment.<br>

  title: "Brain QR Modem - A setup to stream MRI images unidirectionally to the cloud via QR code animations"
  image: qrmodem.gif
  details: "Have you ever been annoyed how hard it is to get brain data off the scanner? The fact that scanners usually
  contain private information about patients and are thus embedded in maximally restrictive clinical cyber-security
  environments, makes it quite complicated to get access to the data. Especially when visiting collaborative sites.
  In this Hackathon project, we aim to develop a purely uni-directional (safe) data streaming “hack” to transfer MRI
  data directly to the cloud by means dynamic QR codes. In the early days of the Internet, modems
  (modulator-demodulator) were used to (i) convert digital information into audio streams, (ii) transfer them across
  telephone lines, and (iii) convert them back into the digital domain. Here, we aim to do the same thing with pixel
  data of MRI scans. However, instead of audio signal we will use machine-readable visual information: QR codes.<br>

  details: "After 🎆 exploding brains 🎆 in the last year's brainhack, now it is time for animations of a more relaxing
  sort. I will be mainly using a few LayNii programs that I have been developing for high resolution imaging over the
  last year (e.g. layers, columns) to generate mesmerizing brain animations. I will focus on using animal brains from
  one of my favorite projects: https://braincatalogue.org/.<br>

  title: "Phys2BIDScoin: Integrating BIDScoin and phys2bids for a user-friendly GUI based BIDS conversion of physiological files"
  image: BIDScoin.png
  details: "Phys2bids is a python3 toolkit meant to format physiological files in BIDS. BIDScoin is also a python3 toolkit 
  that is meant to format MRI source files in BIDS. BIDScoin comes with a data discovery routine and a graphical interface 
  to customize the formatting heuristics. The actual data discovery and formatting is done using plugins and the BIDScoin
  framework itself is agnostic about the source modality. Phys2bids currently lacks data discovery functionality and 
  BIDScoin lacks a formatting backend for physiological data. The goal of this project is to develop the plugin interface
  between BIDScoin and phys2bids and hence combine their complementary functionality for both projects.<br>

  title: "Physiological signal classification challenge"
  image: physiopy.png
  details: "Phys2bids is a python3 library to format physiological files in BIDS. One of the current development goals is 
  to make phys2bids smarter by implementing an automatic signal classificator. Ideally, given a physiological signal as 
  input, phys2bids should be able to determine the type of the signal (cardiac, respiratory …).<br><br>
  To move forward, this project is structured as a challenge: we provide time-series data of 4 kinds of physiological 
  signals (cardiac, respiratory_chest, O2 and CO2) and the goal will be to collaborate to find robust features that 
  allow discerning between them.<br>

  title: "ARTEM-IS web app: working towards an Agreed Reporting Template for EEG Methodology (International Standard)"
  image: ARTEM-IS.png
  details: "The dense data streams and analytical flexibility of electroencephalography (EEG), result in a substantial
  ‘Garden of Forking Paths’. Recent research (<a href=https://psyarxiv.com/jp6wy>Šoškić et al 2021</a>) shows that most research reports do not contain
  sufficient detail in their methods to know which path has been taken, hampering reproducibility, replication and meta-science.
  Our initiative to create an Agreed Reporting Template for an International Standard (<a href=https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/PDX6Y>ARTEM-IS</a>) includes
  a draft template designed to make reporting EEG methodology easier and more accurate, by providing fields for researchers 
  to input specific methodological details. Read more about why we need this tool and how you can help 
  to make it better in our (<a href=https://psyarxiv.com/myn7t>preprint</a>).<br>

  details: "Phys2bids provides a way to convert physiological recording files to bids format. This brainhack project acts
  as user testing for the software by applying its workflow to a large-scale dataset. The Courtois Neuromod project is 
  a longitudinal program which collects massive amounts of multimodal data (neuroimaging, peripheral physiologicals signal
  and eye-tracking) with the same 6 subjects throughout different tasks. We want to apply the phys2bids workflow 
  to the entire physiological signals (electrocardiographic, electrodermal, respiration and pulse) dataset.<br>

  title: "Developing collective action campaigns for the neuroimaging community"
  image: fok.png
  details: "Academia is trapped in a collective action problem: we all know there are better ways we could be doing
  things, but feel pressured to 'play the game' in order to survive a competitive career in science. Historically,
  collective action problems like this have been solved with collective action, i.e. the mass uptake of new behaviours
  that aim to further the group's interests. More recently, online conditional pledge platforms (e.g., Kickstarter)
  have demonstrated that collective action can be organised on a global scale with zero risk to users, serving to cut
  out middle-men and directly benefit the users themselves. At present, however, this strategy has yet to take hold in academia.
  <br><br>
  Project Free Our Knowledge (FOK) aims to rectify this by organising collective action in the research community.
  Using our platform, researchers can pledge to support open science practices, subject to there being a critical mass
  of support for the proposed behaviour. If the threshold is achieved, everyone who has pledged is contacted and
  directed to carry out the action together, thus motivating cultural change with minimal risk to individuals.<br>

  details: "Brain Electrophysiology Laboratory is proud to present FLOW (Forward Looking Operations Workflow), an
  all-in-one solution for EEG database management, ERP analysis pipelines, and visualization with AWS cloud or
  on-premises server implementations. We use containerization technology to run ERP analysis Python scripts as
  modular units with I/O to the FLOW database, thus facilitating reproducibility across different stages of analysis.
  The containerization approach allows easy integration of existing analysis scripts, thus making FLOW an environment
  the can be adjusted to lab needs.<br>

  title: "cleanBibImpact: Evaluating the impact of citation diversity statements"
  image: cleanbibimpact.png
  details: "Gender imbalance is a big problem in academic research, and it is even reflected in our citation behavior.
  Our goal is to assess the 'impact' of the <a href=https://github.com/dalejn/cleanBib>cleanBib</a> tool, which was created to make researchers more aware of this problem. 
  his tool can be used to assess the gender balance of authors in a reference list. Specifically, we want to find papers
  that cite the cleanBib <a href=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3672109>code</a>/<a href=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-0658-y>paper</a>/<a href=https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.03.894378>preprint</a>, and see whether those citing papers have better gender balance 
  n their reference lists than papers that do not.
  <br><br>
  In previous hackathons, we created this figure by manually collecting citation diversity data from papers with 
  citation diversity statements. It shows the relative gender proportions in reference lists of papers 
  with diversity statements (relative to the expected gender proportions).<br>
